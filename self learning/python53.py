#MAP
# function for cube of a number
def cube(x):
    return x*x*x
print(cube(2))

# if i need to pass a list as an argument directly it will give me an error
# so we use a loop and a new list to perform the operation
l1 =[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
nl1=[]
for i in l1:
    nl1.append(cube(i))
print(nl1)
# the above method is so long 

# so we use map function
nl2 =list(map(cube,l1))# map function takes 2 arguments 1 the function to perform and other on which iteratable object to perform
print(nl2)

# FILTER
#function that checks the crediblity of the given element
def fil_fun(a):
    return a>4

#filter function filters the following list with respect to filter_function()
nl3=list(filter(fil_fun,l1))#the fil_fun must return bool datatype for every element of the l1
print(nl3)

#REDUCE
from functools import reduce

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)# use lambda functions for smaller code
print(result)
