HARDEST CHOICE REQUIRS THE HARDEST WILL
its hard to see the people you made memories with slowly become ypur memory
iam not wrong what's wrong ,is this messedup world
-"in human society lands are ssplit with borders marking their territories 
on the right side children may starve to death 
on the left side however idel dreds who do nothing have every thing"
wars will only lead to dispair 
that dispair will serve as a fuel this world to burn
