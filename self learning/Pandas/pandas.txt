pandas 1

data manipulation: changing ,organising or preparing data to make it useful and easier to understand
data analysis: extracting patterns ,trends and insights from the data to solve problems

pandas is a python open source library designed for data manipulation and data analysis
it fimplifies working with structured datasets like tables spreadsheets or time series data.

key features 
. works well with csv and excel data formats
. handels missing values easily 
. build on numpy for fast computation

series : 
-it is a one dimensional labeled array that can hold any datatype
-each element in the series has a unique label called an index

data frame :
- it is a 2 dimensional labeled data structure in pandas 
- it is similar to table in database 
- it consists of rows and columns 
	-rows have indices 
	-columns have names

encoding in file system , it is a format in which data is stored so that system can understand the data
there are 2 standard encoding systems in data science 
1. utf-8
2. latin1
some systems dont have the builtin system to encode automatically so we need to specify the encoding during the creation of dataframe

how to create a dataframe using pandas

refrence = pandas.read_csv("file name (or) location")

specifying encoding standard 
refrence = pandas.read_csv("file name (or) location",encoding = "latin1")

to remove index column 
refrence = pandas.read_csv("file name (or) location",index= False)
here we will get a problem if there is no index then 1st column will become index
then we are unable to access the column for manipulation

print(referance)
prints the dataframe

create a new dataframe and store the data in a file
to remove index column give index = false

pandas 2
before working with a dataset we need to understand the data set meaning we need to analyse the data

steps :
understand the data 
identify the problems
plan the next steps/manipulation of data

data understanding 
- we need to under stand the structure of the data 

there are some basic codes in pandas to verify the dataset like its structur ,arrangement etc
1. df.head() # stores first 5 rows of the data by default but we can modify that 
2. df.tail() # stores the  last 5 rows of the data by default but we can change that

identifying problems
how many column and rows
what type of data
missing data

for these problems we have 
info() # this method has the info on the data
. number of rows and columns
. column names 
. datatype of the data 
. non null values count
. memory usage

and one more function ie,
it is a powerful method
describe() # this method describes some important statistical representations and calculations of the dataset
. it only describes to the numerical columns 
. count # representing the elements present in those following column
. mean of the values
. standard deviation
. min # minimum value of the column
. 25% # bottem 25% of the sorted column
. 50% # middle element of the sorted column 
. 75% # top 25% of the sorted column
. max max value in the column

and before doing the manipulation of data we need to know 2 things
. how big the dataset is 
. what are the names of the columns 
for this we have
. shape()
. columns()
this will return a tuple of the info

to plan the next step of the data analysis
. select specific column
. filter rows
. combine multiple conditions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pandas 3 
data manipulation
. adding column
. updating values
. removing column
. replacing column
. handling missing values


adding column
df["column_name"] = [data] 
or
df.insert(location of the column,column name,data)

updating values
df.loc[row_index,"column_name"] new value

deleting a row or a column
df.drop(columns = [column_name],inplace = True)

handeling missing values 
pandas represents missing values in 2 types ie
. NaN (not a number)
. None (for objects)

to check the missing values we have
df.isnull() # this returns a table containing boolean values ie false for values and true for missing values
or
df.isnull().sum() # this will return the number of missing values in every column

we can either drop the column or row containg missing values
or 
we can fill the missing values

for droping the row 
df.dropna(axis = 0 ,inplace = True)
for droping a column
df.dropna(axis = 1 ,inplace = True)

for fixing the missing values we have 
df.fillna(val,inplace = True)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pandas 4
interpolation
filling a missing value with an estimated value for a numerical method
. used to preserve data integrety
. smooth trends
. to avoide data loss 

in pandas we have
interpolation(method)
there are lots of interpolation methods but commonly used ones are
linear
polynomial
time
splean
quadratic
nearest
zero
piecewise polynomial

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pandas 5 
sorting
df.sort-values(by = "column name",ascending = true for ascending order false for descending order,inplace = true)

aggrigation of data
. summary statistics - provides come of the statistical analysisof the columns
ex : df[columnname].mean()
     df[columnname].sum()  etc...

data grouping :
dividing the data the data into small groups
df.groupby("column name of which with respect to grouping is done")["column name target for the following droup"]
df.groupby(columnname)[columnname] # this provides a grouped object to get the balues we need to summaries the values
so we need to use summary statistics like
df.groupby(columnname)[columnname].mean()
